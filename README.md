# Fetch

![Fetch](http://i.imgur.com/B8TXlri.png)

Fetch enables easy fetching of data from multiple web sources.
It was extracted from [Bogrobotten](http://www.bogrobotten.dk) where we use it
to fetch prices and other stuff from multiple merchants.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's *Gemfile*:

```ruby
gem "fetch"
```

Then run:

```bash
$ bundle
```
